### Food Recipes

---

# Problem:

Write a web application for managing food recipes. The application should maintain various information about a recipe in the database (i.e. author, name, type, the actual recipe etc.). The application should implement: recipes browsing (use AJAX for retrieving recipes of a specific type), adding, removing and updating a recipe. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. recipe type), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
